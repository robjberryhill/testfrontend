    <h2>Holistic Formation</h2>
    <h5> November 8, 2018</h5>

    <p>We cannot behave on the spot like Jesus did if the rest of the time we are living
      just as everyone else does. <br> It begins with a desire from the inside outt
      to live as Christ. <br> Spiritual Formation is this: the spirit driven process
of forming the inner world of the human self in such a waythat it becomes like the
inner being of Christ Himself!

    <h5> December 1, 2018</h5>

    <p> Practical Tips: <br>
    1. Find a queit place alone and start 10 minutes of silence with God.<br>
  2. Come with a phrase that will help you keep focused. "I've come to meet You in this place"<br>
3. Come with a question for Jesus or say what is truly on your heart.<br> This doesnt mean
you have to leave with an answer, but it's learning to leave it as His feet.<br>
4. REST, nap...Rest is holy. </p>
